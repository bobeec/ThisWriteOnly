== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why are there so few customization options? =

By design! BLOGthemeWP focuses on content, not design decisions. The typography, spacing, and layout are optimized for the best reading experience.

= Can I add more blocks to the editor? =

The theme intentionally limits available blocks to maintain simplicity. If you need more blocks, you can modify the `blogthemewp_allowed_block_types` function in functions.php.

= Does this theme support WooCommerce? =

No. BLOGthemeWP is designed exclusively for blogs and does not support e-commerce functionality.
